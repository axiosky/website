                        <p class="team-member-content">The technical architecture that makes AI agents certifiable: pre-execution policy enforcement, deterministic compliance logic, and immutable audit trails. Every design decision prioritizes correctness, auditability, and regulatory defensibility over features or speed.</p>

                        <p class="team-member-content">Governance can't be added to autonomous systems—it must be architectural. I'm building infrastructure where enforcement is impossible to bypass, policies are provably correct, and audit trails survive legal scrutiny. This is infrastructure work, not application work.</p>

                    <p>We don't abstract regulations into requirements documents. We work directly with your compliance teams, map regulatory text to enforceable logic, write policy code, and validate with your legal counsel. This requires deep domain engagement, not scaled product teams.</p>
